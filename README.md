3min break

"Please draw 2/4th of a mental circle around you."
"This is your **space of outward intent**. Thought processes directed outward will stabilize your perception of others and create the way forward. Think about how you intend to treat others."

3min break

"Please draw a 3/4th full mental circle around you."
"This is your **space of higher intent**. Thought processes directed into the void will summon positive energy within you. Think about how you intend to use that energy."

3min break

"Please draw a full mental circle around you."
"This is your **space of general intent**. Thought processes now need to be grounded on the observed reality and will gain initial direction and create a spark of willpower due to clarity. Think about your day's overall intent and focus."
